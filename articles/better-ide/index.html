        <p class="article-date">

        </p>

        <p class="wip italic">
            This article is a <span class="bold">work-in-progress</span>. I'm not actually
            sure how you found this! But if you find what I've written so far interesting,
            email me, and I'll update you when I've finished it.
        </p>

        <p>
            This article hopes to take you on a crazy ride through the world of logical
            constraints, symbolic execution, AI coding assistants, knowledge bases,
            IDEs, and how I think they could all come together to make one
            <span class="italic">beautiful</span> piece of software. I haven't written
            this software yet, but rather, this article outlines my plans for how it
            could be done <span class="italic">really well</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>My Love of Constraints</h2>
        <p>
        <p>
            I have always been fascinated with constraints. When I was little, I often
            tested the constraints of my parents, and now, I love using constraints to
            type-check my programs, make logical inferences from data, and to find
            bugs in my programs before they raise hard-to-debug errors. Constraints
            bring <span class="italic">order</span> to complex systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, with the recent advancements in AI coding assistants such as GitHub
            CoPilot and ChatGPT (amazing btw!), it seems that we have been largely ignoring
            the value of constraints. I have even seen the sentiment that we just have to
            wait for the AI to get better, and then the AI will solve all the constraints
            itself. Frankly, I think this is <span class="italic">very optimistic</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I understand why people think this.
        </p>
        <p>
            These assistants do such a great job of predicting short snippets of code, and
            they are getting better so fast, that it has seemed inevitable that they will
            take over everything. Also, constraints aren't nearly as trendy. Although, while
            the general utility of these coding assistants is unmatched by other techniques
            such as genetic programming, their reliability is not even close to 100%. In fact,
            their use has already been shown to
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">lead to security vulnerabilities</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this article, I hope to argue that
            there is a huge opportunity to leverage "old" logical constraint systems alongside
            the new modern coding assistants to build large, sophisticated systems more
            effectively. I also argue why a custom IDE would be needed, instead of just
            building this into a tool or plugin. Let's dive in!

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed programming, and so I tend to do it
                    <span class="italic">a lot</span>.
                    However, even with a connection so strong, I feel I do have
                    to take a break from programming occasionally. Therefore,
                    instead, I decided that it would be fun to write about some
                    programming ideas I find interesting! I hope you find them
                    interesting as well. You can read more about my actual
                    qualifications and work <a href="/">here</a>.
