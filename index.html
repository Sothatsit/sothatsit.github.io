        I am passionate about building high-quality and impactful software projects
        in diverse areas. I am also very interested in the nature of human knowledge
        and memory. Some articles and projects that I'm proud of are listed below!

                </a>

                I created <a href="https://royalur.net">RoyalUr.net</a>, a website where
                over 500 people each day play the Royal Game of Ur. The Royal Game of Ur
                is an ancient Mesopotamian racing board game, that dates back to 2500BC.
                It is considered to be a predecessor to Backgammon. As of writing, there
                are about 400 games played every day on RoyalUr.net. This project is also
                <a href="https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrClient">open-source</a>.

                    <img src="/assets/misinformation-game.png" alt="The Misinformation Game Logo" />
                </a>

                I was a part of creating, and I continue to maintain,
                <a href="https://themisinformationgame.github.io">The Misinformation Game</a>,
                a social media simulator built to study people's behaviour when they
                interact with social media. A <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/628wc/">paper</a>
                about this tool is currently under revision for the Behavior Research Methods
                journal. This project is also
                <a href="https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame">open-source</a>.

        <li>
            <div class="project">

                         width="256" height="231" />
                </a>

                I built <a href="https://github.com/TycheLibrary/Tyche">Tyche</a>,
                a Python library for building belief models and reasoning
                logically about them. Belief models are represented as
                knowledge bases of entities, with probabilistic beliefs
                about the entities, and probabilistic relationships between them.
                The probability of beliefs holding can then be queried using
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13036">aleatoric description logic</a>.
                The library also contains a novel approach to learning the
                probabilities within belief models based upon observations,
                which has showed promise. It's a bit technical, but I really
                like it.

                         width="16" height="16" />
                </a>

                I also played a part in the creation of
                <a href="https://github.com/PubMedConnections/PubMedConnections">PubMed Connections</a>.
                PubMed Connections is a tool to convert the
                <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed dataset</a>
                into a Neo4J graph database, alongside a website to visualise the
                contents of the database. The project has a focus on visualising
                the authors of articles in PubMed, along with their relationships
                to one another. The goal of this project was to analyse and
                visualise the collaboration of academics.
