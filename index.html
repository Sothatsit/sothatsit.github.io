        Bucky Roberts from thenewboston taught me to program. As a kid I would watch
        Bucky&apos;s
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-zzrqQoSE&list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28">Java tutorials</a>,
        make command-line programs, and use them to show-off to or prank my brother.
        I remember one particularly great program I made. It asked my brother a series
        of questions, including asking for his name. Then, it would print
        &quot;Liam is a fart&quot;. A work of art.

        I have made Java calculators, Scratch games, Minecraft mods, my own RuneScape
        botting client, JSON parsers, and a misinformation research tool. Now I&apos;m
        working on the Royal Game of Ur. I have started hundreds of projects, and
        <a href="https://royalur.net">RoyalUr.net</a>
        is my latest one. It&apos;s going pretty well!

    <h2 id="now">What am I doing now?</h2>
    <p>
        I recently moved out of London, and into the small town of Canberra, Australia,
        where I can fulfil my dreams of a hermit existence. I spend half my time working
        for DUG, and half my time following my interests and working on projects like
        <a href="https://royalur.net/solved">solving the Royal Game of Ur</a>.

                If you&apos;ve ever wondered how someone might solve
                an ancient board game, this article runs through the entire
                process of solving the Royal Game of Ur.

                I created <a href="https://royalur.net">RoyalUr.net</a>, a website where
                you can play one of the oldest board games in the world, the Royal Game
                of Ur. I also
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.2478/bgs-2023-0001">wrote a paper on the game</a>,
                and have recently managed to
                <a href="https://royalur.net/solved">solve the game</a>.
                The Royal Game of Ur is an ancient Mesopotamian racing board game
                that dates back to 2500BC. It is considered to be a predecessor to Backgammon.

                I was a part of creating, and I continue to maintain,
                <a href="https://misinfogame.com">The Misinformation Game</a>,
                a social media simulator built to study people&apos;s behaviour when they
                interact with social media. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02153-x">paper</a>
                about this tool has been published in the Behavior Research Methods journal.
                This project is also
                <a href="https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame">open-source</a>.

                I built <a href="https://github.com/TycheLibrary/Tyche">Tyche</a>,
                a Python library for building belief models and reasoning
                logically about them. Belief models are represented as
                knowledge bases of entities, with probabilistic beliefs
                about the entities, and probabilistic relationships between them.
                The probability of beliefs holding can then be queried using
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13036">aleatoric description logic</a>.
                The library also contains a novel approach to learning the
                probabilities within belief models based upon observations,
                which has showed promise. It&apos;s a bit technical, but I really
                like it.

                I have made hundreds of Minecraft server plugins and mods. Some of them are even
                <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/sothatsit.2764/">still used</a>.
                I made everything from flying carpets to minigames for big servers to npc plugins
                and hack clients. One plugin I am particularly proud of was for a hundred lines of
                code or less challenge. It allowed you to ride any mob in the game
                by modifying the bytecode of the server during runtime - and it only needed
                85 lines of code!
